                                Thank you for visiting a website or application provided by the Flexed Yoga (“FLEXED YOGA”) and its affiliates ("FLEXED YOGA") are committed to respecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy outlines FLEXED YOGA's collection and use of information ("Privacy Policy"). FLEXED YOGA currently owns or operates the FLEXED YOGA brand, among others. These brands may be updated from time to time by FLEXED YOGA without notice.
                                FLEXED YOGA collects information through: (a) its websites and digital properties including, but not limited to, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest and YouTube; and (b) through our various other messaging, telephone and other forms of communications, mobile technologies, applications and services, and from various third parties in each case, as may be updated by FLEXED YOGA from time to time (collectively, the "FLEXED YOGA Services").
                                This Privacy Policy is current as of the Effective Date. Please consult this Privacy Policy from time to time since FLEXED YOGA may, at any time, and without notice, revise this Privacy Policy by updating this posting.<br><br>
                                2.	What types of information does FLEXED YOGA collect from you?<br>
                                FLEXED YOGA Services<br>
                                FLEXED YOGA collects certain information through the FLEXED YOGA Services described above - including through our websites, through social media accounts and channels, and via our applications, mobile technologies, telephone discussions, email and other forms of communication, including text messaging. In order for you to place orders, make purchases, complete transactions, interact with FLEXED YOGA or have access to certain features of the FLEXED YOGA Services, we may require you to register or provide certain information. This information may include, but is not limited to, your name, phone number, postal address, email address, age or date of birth, payment information, rewards program information or a username and password.<br><br>
                                Purchase and Recipient Information<br>
                                When making purchases through the FLEXED YOGA Services, we may also require you to provide a credit card or other payment information, billing address and gift message and that you provide information about a recipient or potential recipient of a gift or a purchase you make through the FLEXED YOGA Services.<br><br>
                                Social Media Sites<br>
                                FLEXED YOGA may also receive information from social media, as well as from people with whom you are friends or otherwise connected on social media. For example, if you access the FLEXED YOGA Services through a third-party connection or log in through Instagram, Twitter, Facebook Connect or another third-party service, by "following," "liking," or linking your account to one or more of the FLEXED YOGA Services, that third party may pass information about you to us, including, without limitation, your name, birthday, gender, user ID number, user ID number of your friends, the email address associated with your account, your profile picture, your physical location, your photos, photo likes, photo tags, and an access token to authenticate to the third-party service. We may also collect additional information regarding your hobbies, interests or "likes" that you make available through your profile on the third-party service, any other information that you have permitted the third party to share with us, and any information you have made public in connection with that service.
                                If you allow us access to your social media friends list, then your friends' user IDs and your connection to those friends may be used and stored to make your experience more social, and to allow you to invite your friends to use the FLEXED YOGA Services. Please consult with the third party's website for further information before you link or connect to the FLEXED YOGA Services and on how to control or adjust your privacy settings on that site. FLEXED YOGA has no control over such third party website.<br><br>
                                Third Parties<br>
                                We may supplement the information you provide to us with data we obtain or receive from third parties, such as our affiliates, marketing firms, data vendors or address verification services. For example, if you change your address and fail to advise us, we may verify your address through a third party address verification company. We may combine information we collect online, from you, and through other means described in this policy with information we collect offline and from third parties.<br><br>
                                Mobile Applications<br>
                                Our mobile applications may access information on your device. For example, when placing an order through our mobile applications you may enter a shipping address from your device's address book or receive birthday reminders for contacts; or if placing an order including an image our application would require access to your device's photo library.<br><br>
                                3.	What information does FLEXED YOGA automatically collect?<br>
                                FLEXED YOGA may collect other information about you when you use the FLEXED YOGA Services including, but not limited to, demographic data, location data (as more fully discussed in Section 7 below), browser type, your Internet Service Provider or operating system, device identifier, the URL of previous FLEXED YOGA Services you visited and other websites and mobile apps you have interacted with, and your IP address.<br><br>
                                4.	What are cookies, clear GIFs and other similar technologies and how does FLEXED YOGA use them?<br>
                                Cookies: We may collect information from you by using cookies. A "cookie" is a small text file stored on your computer containing information about you. Cookies help us analyze web traffic, provide user data for a particular webpage, and allow web applications to be adapted for you as an individual. This helps us tailor our operations to your specific needs and preferences by gathering and remembering information about your preferences. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies. If you would prefer to prevent your computer from accepting our cookies, please follow your Internet browser's steps for doing so. However, if you do disable cookies, you may not be able to take full advantage of all our online features or access certain sections of our FLEXED YOGA Services, including the "shopping cart."<br>
                                Clear GIFs: We, or our third party partners, affiliates, agents or service providers, may collect information from you by using clear GIFs. A "clear GIF" or graphics interchange format (also known as pixel tags, single pixel GIFs, web beacons or action tags) help us or a third party measure advertising effectiveness. Clear GIFs help us manage content on the FLEXED YOGA Services by informing us of what content is effective. Further, clear GIFs may be used: (i) in HTML based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients; (ii) to record when products have been ordered through the FLEXED YOGA Services; and (iii) to track the visitor traffic through the FLEXED YOGA Services. Among other reasons, these clear GIFs allow us to measure the usage of each of the FLEXED YOGA Services by our visitors and the effectiveness of certain communications and marketing campaigns. The main differences between a cookie and a clear GIF are that clear GIFs are invisible on a web page and are much smaller.<br>
                                Session Information: We, or our third-party partners, agents, or service providers, may collect information about your interaction with the FLEXED YOGA Services, including the resources that you access, pages viewed, how much time you spent on a page, and how you reached our website. We, our agent, or a third party also automatically record the details of your visits to our websites and real-time session information generated in the course of using our websites, such as mouse movements, clicks, page visits, text entered, how long you spent on a page, and other details of your actions on our websites.<br>
                                Mobile Analytics: We utilize third party analytics technology in our mobile applications which tracks usage and interactions within our mobile applications. This information helps provide insight into the use of such mobile applications and assists with our further improvement and development associated with the mobile application and FLEXED YOGA Services.<br>
                                Affiliate Tracking: You may purchase products from us through a link associated with our affiliate program. Our affiliate program allows participating website publishers, bloggers and other organizations ("Affiliates") to display links on their respective websites which direct customers to the FLEXED YOGA Services.<br>
                                Interactive Services (Chatbot and Managed Chat) Consent and Disclaimers: We may provide interactive services, including chatbot and managed chat. By accessing or using any of these features, you agree that we may record and retain a transcript of all communications with you via these interactive tools in order to provide services, enhance your website experience, and for quality and verification purposes. We may work with trusted providers to analyze, store, and/or use this data on our behalf. Your use or access of these tools or of our website is governed by this section, our Terms of Use, and our Privacy Policy.<br><br>
                                5.	How does FLEXED YOGA collect and use location based data?<br>
                                When you access the FLEXED YOGA Services by or through a mobile device or application, we may access, collect, monitor and/or remotely store "location data," which may include GPS coordinates (e.g., latitude and/or longitude) or similar information regarding the location of your mobile device. Location data may convey to us information about how you browse and use the FLEXED YOGA Services. We may also be able to determine your general geographic location (i.e., city or town and state) through your IP address. You may control whether location data is shared with us through your mobile device, application or browser settings. Some features of the FLEXED YOGA Services, particularly location-based services, may not function properly if use or availability of location data is impaired or disabled.<br><br>
                                6.	How does FLEXED YOGA use information collected from you?<br>
                                FLEXED YOGA may use information we collect in order:<br>

                                4.	As necessary or appropriate to protect our rights, privacy, safety or property, and/or that of our affiliated companies, you or others, and to allow us to pursue available remedies or limit the damages that we may sustain.<br>

                                7.	To comply with legal and regulatory requirements, and to enforce our terms of service.<br>
                                
                                
                                8.	To fulfill other actions when we have your consent.<br><br>
                                
                                To the extent you participate with interactive features through the FLEXED YOGA Services such as the social media sites or by leaving reviews on the FLEXED YOGA Services, any information that you provide may be published to the public in the manner consistent with the interactive feature. For example, if you tag a photo through Instagram with #FLEXED YOGA or @FLEXED YOGA, we may repost that photo under @FLEXED YOGA.<br><br>
                                To the extent you participate in any sweepstakes, promotions or contests through the FLEXED YOGA Services, any information provided by you may be used in accordance with separate or different terms and conditions under the applicable rules of such sweepstakes, promotion or contest, which may differ from this Privacy Policy.<br><br>
                                By providing information through the FLEXED YOGA Services (including through our mobile applications), you authorize us to share information among our family of websites and mobile applications.
